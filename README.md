## Knowledge Graphs Demystified Part 2: Practical Session

This is the repository for the practical session of the "Knowledge Graphs Demystified" master class by Dr Michael Stewart from the Centre for Transforming Maintenance through Data Science (CTMTDS).

In this session I will be demonstrating a jupyter notebook containing code for creating a knowledge graph from a set of sample work orders.

To run this code you will need Python 3 and Jupyter notebook installed, as well as the `py2neo` python package. To run the code, open "Knowledge Graphs Demystified.ipynb" in Jupyter. To run part 3 onwards you will need to install Neo4j, as discussed the notebook.

The notebook is located here: [Knowledge Graphs Demystified.ipynb](<https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/knowledge-graphs-demystified/blob/main/Knowledge Graphs Demystified.ipynb>).
