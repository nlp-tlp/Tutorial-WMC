## WMC Tutorial - A Practical Guide to Knowledge Graph Construction from Technical Short Text

This is the repository for the practical session of the WMC Turorial by the University of Western Australia (supported by the Centre for Transforming Maintenance through Data Science (CTMTDS)).

The slides are included in this repository (`Knowledge Graphs.pdf`).

We will be walking through a Jupyter notebook containing code for creating a knowledge graph from a set of sample work orders.

To run this code you will need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed. To run the code, open `WMC.ipynb` in Jupyter.

Note that you will need Neo4j Desktop installed for Sections 8 and 9 of the notebook. You can download it [here](https://neo4j.com/download/). Once you have downloaded it, you will need to run Neo4j and create a new graph database, and run that database. Further instructions are provided in the notebook.
